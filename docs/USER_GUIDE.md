## Getting Started

### What is Window?

Window is a day planner that helps you visualize your day in 24 one-hour blocks (from midnight to midnight). Each activity you log affects your daily stats: energy, food, and mood.

### Your First Look

When you open Window, you'll see:

1. **Stats Panel** (top) - Shows your current energy, meals/snacks consumed, and mood
2. **Time Block Grid** (center) - 24 blocks representing each hour of your day
3. **Date Navigator** (top) - Navigate between days and clear activities

### Quick Start

1. **Click any empty time block** to add an activity
2. **Enter the activity name** (e.g., "Morning Walk", "Work", "Lunch")
3. **Select exertion level** (how much energy it requires)
4. **Choose activity type** (exerting or restorative)
5. **Click "add activity"** to save

That's it! Your stats will update automatically.

## Understanding Your Stats

### Energy (0-100 points)

Energy represents your daily capacity to do things. It starts at 0 and changes based on activities:

- **Exerting activities** consume energy (based on exertion level)
- **Restorative activities** restore energy (based on exertion level)
- **Sleep** gives you +15 energy per hour (capped at 100)
- **Goal**: Keep energy above 20 points

#### Energy Warning

When your energy drops below 20 points, you'll see a warning. Time to rest!

### Food (Meals & Snacks)

Track what you eat throughout the day:

- **Meals** give +30 points each
- **Snacks** give +10 points each
- **Daily Goal**: 3 meals + 1 snack

Food doesn't affect your energy - it's a separate tracking system to help you maintain healthy eating habits.

### Mood

Select your mood state from 5 options:

- 😢 **sad**
- 😠 **mad**
- 😐 **neutral** (default)
- 🙂 **happy**
- 😄 **very happy**

Your mood is independent of activities - update it anytime to reflect how you're feeling!

## Managing Activities

### Adding an Activity

1. **Click any time block** (or click the "+" icon if block is empty)
2. **Fill in the details**:
   - Name: What are you doing?
   - Exertion level: How demanding is it?
   - Type: Is it exerting or restorative?
3. **Submit the form**

### Exertion Levels

Choose the appropriate level based on how demanding the activity is:

- **very low** - Minimal effort (watching TV, light reading)
- **low** - Light activity (casual walking, cooking)
- **moderate** - Standard effort (work, errands, socializing)
- **high** - Demanding activity (intense work, exercise, chores)
- **very high** - Maximum effort (intense exercise, moving, major projects)

### Activity Types

- **Exerting** - Activities that consume energy (work, exercise, chores)
- **Restorative** - Activities that restore energy (relaxing, hobbies, meditation)

The same exertion level has opposite effects:

- Exerting "high" = -20 energy
- Restorative "high" = +20 energy

### Editing an Activity

1. **Click on an existing activity** in its time block
2. **Modify any details** you want to change
3. **Click "update activity"** to save

### Deleting an Activity

1. **Click on an activity** to open the edit form
2. **Click "delete [activity name]"** button
3. Activity will be removed and stats will recalculate

### Multi-Hour Activities

Some activities span multiple hours (like work or sleep). You have two options:

1. **Log each hour separately** - Gives you more granular control
2. **Use the Work Logger** (for work) or **Sleep Logger** - Quick entry for multi-hour blocks

## Special Activities

### Sleep

Sleep is special - it gives you +15 energy per hour (up to 100 max).

**Using the Sleep Logger**:

1. Open the quick actions menu
2. Select "log sleep"
3. Choose start time (bedtime) and end time (wake up)
4. Submit to create sleep blocks for all hours

**Manual Sleep Entry**:

- Create an activity named "sleep" (or "nap", "rest")
- The app auto-detects it and applies sleep energy rules

### Food

Track meals and snacks throughout your day.

**Using the Food Logger**:

1. Open quick actions
2. Select "log food"
3. Choose meal or snack
4. Select the hour you ate
5. Submit to track it

**Manual Food Entry**:

- Name activities: "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", "snack"
- Choose the food category when creating the activity
- Set meal or snack type

### Work Sessions

For focused work blocks:

1. Open quick actions
2. Select "log work"
3. Enter what you're working on
4. Set start and end times
5. Choose exertion level
6. Submit to create work blocks

## Day Navigation

### Navigating Days

- **← Previous Day** - View yesterday
- **→ Next Day** - View tomorrow
- **Today** - Jump back to current day
- **Date Display** - Shows currently selected date

### Viewing History

All your past days are saved. Navigate to any day to see what you did and how your stats looked.

### Starting Fresh

Use the **Clear All Activities** button to remove all activities for the current day. This resets stats to default (0 energy, 0 meals, 0 snacks).

**Warning**: This cannot be undone!

## Tips for Effective Use

### Energy Management

1. **Start with sleep** - Log your sleep first to set your daily energy baseline
2. **Balance activities** - Mix exerting and restorative activities
3. **Watch the warning** - When energy drops below 20, plan a break
4. **End-of-day goal** - Try to end the day with 20+ energy

### Activity Logging

1. **Be specific** - "Work: Client meeting" is better than "Work"
2. **Log as you go** - Update throughout the day for accuracy
3. **Use the Work Logger** - For long work sessions (saves time)
4. **Don't over-optimize** - It's okay to approximate exertion levels

### Food Tracking

1. **Hit your goals** - Aim for 3 meals + 1 snack daily
2. **Log when convenient** - You can add food activities anytime
3. **Use the Food Logger** - Quick access from any time block

### Mood Tracking

1. **Update regularly** - Check in with your mood 2-3 times per day
2. **Be honest** - The value is in tracking real feelings
3. **Look for patterns** - Review past days to see mood trends
